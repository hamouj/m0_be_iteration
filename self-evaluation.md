# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?

I feel confident in my understanding of the each method, but I know that after learning many new methods, I will need to practice to remember all the components and become fluent.

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?

I have learned that Google is my best friend! I definitely tried and failed many times throughout the practice activities, but the struggle remained productive. I have noticed that when I run code, the error message usually lets me know what I might have done wrong; it's a very helpful tool!

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

I still need to practice thinking through the task and desired return and then using that to determine the method I need to call and eventually the code I need to write.

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

My questions are:
1. How do I get more practice tasks? I find that the more I get to grapple with understanding the task, the better I get at determining the best method to use/code to write.
1. Where can I find examples of using technical terminology to describe individuals coding?

To get answers, I will use my new best friend, Google!
